# How to contribute

There are few rules to follow:

- Only add images which are not containing any sensitive information
- Keep the images in the proper folders to make it easier to reference them in the modeler forms:
  - choose the proper `phase` folder,
  - for each form there should be a subfolder named after the form,
  - all the images related to the form should be placed in the form subfolder.
- Keep the image names descriptive
